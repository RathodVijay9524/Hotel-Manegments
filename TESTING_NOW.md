## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: "Column 'business_id' not found"**
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Run database migration
mysql -u username -p database < database_migration.sql
```

### **Issue: "businessId is null in response"**
**Solution:**
- Check user has OWNER role
- Check BusinessContextFilter is working
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.username, r.name 
FROM users u 
JOIN users_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id 
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id;
```

### **Issue: "Access denied" on own data**
**Solution:**
- Check business_id in data matches user's business_id
- Check BusinessContextFilter.validateBusinessAccess() logic

### **Issue: Can see other business's data**
**Solution:**
- Service not filtering correctly
- Check service uses businessContext.getCurrentBusinessId()

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**All tests pass if:**
1. ‚úÖ Application starts without errors
2. ‚úÖ Business context shows correct business_id
3. ‚úÖ Creating data auto-assigns business_id
4. ‚úÖ Listing data shows only your business
5. ‚úÖ Cross-business access is blocked

**System is WORKING when:**
- Each owner sees only their data
- Data has correct business_id
- Security is enforced

---

## üéä AFTER SUCCESSFUL TESTING

**You've Proven:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant architecture works
- ‚úÖ Business isolation is complete

- ‚úÖ System is production-ready

**Next Steps:**
1. Update remaining services (optional)
2. Test with multiple hotel owners
3. Implement QR code ordering
4. Launch to production!

**Good luck with testing! üöÄ**
