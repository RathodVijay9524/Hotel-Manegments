# 🔒 HOW DATA ISOLATION WORKS - EXPLAINED

**Your Question:** "If Karina logs in, she can see only her menu items, her employees, her customers?"

**Answer:** ✅ **YES! EXACTLY!**

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### **Scenario: Karina's Hotel**

```
Karina (Owner)
    ↓
    Logs in with username: "karina"
    ↓
    System identifies: user_id = 5 (for example)
    ↓
    BusinessContextFilter knows: businessId = 5
    ↓
    ALL queries automatically filtered by business_id = 5
```

---

## 📊 WHAT KARINA SEES

When Karina logs in and accesses different parts of the system:

### **1. Menu Items**
```java
// Karina requests: GET /api/hotel/menu-items

// Behind the scenes:
Long businessId = businessContext.getCurrentBusinessId(); // Returns 5 (Karina's ID)
List<MenuItem> items = menuItemRepository.findByBusinessId(5);

// Result: ONLY Karina's menu items
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Pizza Margherita (Her menu item)
- ✅ Pasta Carbonara (Her menu item)
- ✅ Tiramisu (Her menu item)

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ John's menu items
- ❌ Sarah's menu items
- ❌ Mike's menu items

---

### **2. Orders**
```java
// Karina requests: GET /api/hotel/orders

// Behind the scenes:
Long businessId = 5; // Karina's ID
List<Order> orders = orderRepository.findByBusinessId(5);

// Result: ONLY orders from Karina's hotel
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Orders placed at HER hotel
- ✅ HER customers' orders

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ Orders from other hotels

---

### **3. Employees (Workers)**
```java
// Karina's workers table already has this relationship:
// workers.user_id = 5 (pointing to Karina)

// When Karina views employees:
List<Worker> employees = workerRepository.findByUserId(5);

// Result: ONLY Karina's employees
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Her waiters
- ✅ Her chefs
- ✅ Her managers

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ Employees from other hotels

---

### **4. Tables**
```java
// Karina requests: GET /api/hotel/tables

Long businessId = 5;
List<RestaurantTable> tables = tableRepository.findByBusinessId(5);

// Result: ONLY Karina's tables
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Table 1, 2, 3 from HER restaurant
- ✅ Their availability status

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ Tables from other hotels

---

### **5. Reservations**
```java
// Karina requests: GET /api/hotel/reservations

Long businessId = 5;
List<TableReservation> reservations = reservationRepository.findByBusinessId(5);

// Result: ONLY reservations at Karina's hotel
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Reservations made for HER restaurant
- ✅ HER customers who booked tables

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ Reservations at other hotels

---

### **6. Customers**
```java
// Karina requests: GET /api/hotel/customers

// Customers are identified through orders:
List<Order> orders = orderRepository.findByBusinessId(5);
// Extract unique customers from these orders

// Result: ONLY customers who ordered from Karina's hotel
```

**Karina sees:**
- ✅ Customers who placed orders at HER hotel
- ✅ Their order history with HER hotel

**Karina does NOT see:**
- ❌ Customers from other hotels

---

## 🔐 SECURITY ENFORCEMENT

### **Example: Karina Tries to Access Another Hotel's Order**

```java
// John's hotel has order ID: 100
// Karina tries: GET /api/hotel/orders/100

public Order getOrderById(Long orderId) {
    Order order = orderRepository.findById(100).orElseThrow();
    // order.businessId = 1 (John's hotel)
    
    // Security check:
    businessContext.validateBusinessAccess(order.getBusinessId());
    // Karina's businessId = 5
    // Order's businessId = 1
    // 5 ≠ 1 → BLOCKED!
    
    throw new RuntimeException("Access denied - This resource belongs to a different business");
}
```

**Result:** ❌ **ACCESS DENIED**

## 🎯 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE

### **Setup:**
```
Hotel 1: John's Grand Plaza (business_id = 1)
Hotel 2: Karina's Italian Restaurant (business_id = 2)
Hotel 3: Sarah's Sunset Resort (business_id = 3)
```

**Karina's Menu:**
- Pizza
- Pasta
- Tiramisu

**Sarah's Menu:**

### **When Each Owner Logs In:**

**John logs in:**
```bash
GET /api/hotel/menu-items
Response: [Burger, Fries, Milkshake] ✅
```

**Karina logs in:**
```bash
GET /api/hotel/menu-items
Response: [Pizza, Pasta, Tiramisu] ✅
```

**Sarah logs in:**
```bash
GET /api/hotel/menu-items
Response: [Lobster, Seafood Platter, Wine] ✅
```

**Each sees ONLY their own data!**

## 🏗️ HOW IT'S BUILT

### **1. Database Level**
```sql
-- Every table has business_id column
CREATE TABLE hotel_menu_items (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- This column!
    name VARCHAR(200),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    ...
);

-- All queries filter by business_id
SELECT * FROM hotel_menu_items WHERE business_id = 2; -- Only Karina's items
```

### **2. Application Level**
```java
@Service
public class MenuService {
    
    @Autowired
    private BusinessContextFilter businessContext;
    
    public List<MenuItem> getAllMenuItems() {
        // Get current user's business ID
        Long businessId = businessContext.getCurrentBusinessId();
        // businessId = 2 (Karina's ID)
        
        // Automatically filtered!
        return menuRepository.findByBusinessId(businessId);
    }
}
```

### **3. Security Level**
```java
// When accessing specific items
public MenuItem getMenuItem(Long itemId) {
    MenuItem item = repository.findById(itemId).orElseThrow();
    
    // Validate: Does this item belong to current user's business?
    businessContext.validateBusinessAccess(item.getBusinessId());
    
    return item;
}
```
